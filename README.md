# Crime-Data-Analysis
Introduction:


In this capstone project, we will use Python, specifically the PyMySQL library, to interact with a MySQL database in order to analyze and gain insights from crime data. The dataset includes information such as DR NO, Date Reported, Date Occurred, Area Name, Crime Code, Crime Code Description, Victim Age, Victim Sex, Premises Description, Status, Location, Latitude, and Longitude.
